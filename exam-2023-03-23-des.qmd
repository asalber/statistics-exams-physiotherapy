The chart below shows the percentage of grades in a Statistic course with 60 students. 

```{r pie-chart-scores, results = "hide", fig.height = 5, fig.width = 6, fig.path = "img/exam-2023-03-23/", fig.cap = ""}
library(lessR)
# Pie chart of grades
PieChart(z, hole = 0, values = "%", data = df, main = "")
```

a. Plot the ogive of the score, assuming the following correspondence between grades and scores

$$
\begin{array}{lc}
  \mbox{Grade} & \mbox{Score}\\
  \mbox{SS} & [0, 5)\\
  \mbox{AP} & [5, 7)\\
  \mbox{NT} & [7,9)\\
  \mbox{SB} & [9,10]
\end{array}
$$

a. Compute the median and interpret it.

a. How many students got a score greater than 8?

a. Study the dispersion of the distribution.

a. Study the skewness of the distribution. Is it normal?

a. If we apply the transformation $y=10x+5$ to the scores, how changes the representativeness of the mean. And the skewness?

Use the following sums for the computations ($X$ = Score):  
$\sum x_in_i=`r round(sum(x), 2)`$, $\sum x_i^2n_i=`r round(sum(x^2), 4)`$, $\sum (x_i-\bar x)^3n_i=`r round(sum((x-mx)^3),2)`$ and $\sum (x_i-\bar x)^4n_i=`r round(sum((x-mx)^4),2)`$.

## Solution
a. Ogive 

```{r ogive-scores, results = "hide", fig.height = 5, fig.width = 6, fig.path = "img/exam-2023-03-23/", fig.cap = ""}
color1 <- "#00BFC4"
plot(c(0, 5, 7, 9, 10), c(0, 0.3, 0.7, 0.95, 1), type = "l", col = color1, xlab = "Score", ylab = "Cumulative relative frequency", axes = F)
axis(1, at = 0:10)
axis(2, at = seq(0,1,0.1))
box()
```

b. $Me = `r me`$ points.

c. $N(8) = `r N8`$ students.

d. $\bar x = `r round(mx, 4)`$ points, $s_x^2=`r round(s2x,4)`$ points$^2$, $s_x=`r round(sx,4)`$ points and $cv_x=`r round(cvx,4)`$. Thus, there is a moderate dispersion with respect to the mean.

e. $g_1 = `r round(g1x,4)`$ and therefore the distribution is a little bit left skewed.

f. $\bar y = `r round(my, 4)`$ points, $s_y^2=`r round(s2y,4)`$ points$^2$, $s_y=`r round(sy,4)`$ points and $cv_y=`r round(cvy,4)`$. As $cv_y < cv_x$ the representativeness of the mean increases. As the slope of the linear transformation is positive, the skewness does not change.

A study tries to determine if there is a relation between the gestation time (in weeks) and the age of the mother (in years). A sample of 40 mothers was taken and the sums below summarize the results ($X$=Age and $Y$=Gestation time):

$\sum x_i=`r round(sum(x), 4)`$ years, $\sum \log(x_i)=`r round(sum(log(x)), 4)`$ log(years), $\sum y_j=`r round(sum(y), 4)`$ weeks, $\sum \log(y_j)=`r round(sum(log(y)), 4)`$ log(weeks),  
$\sum x_i^2=`r round(sum(x^2), 4)`$ years$^2$, $\sum \log(x_i)^2=`r round(sum(log(x)^2), 4)`$ log(years)$^2$, $\sum y_j^2=`r round(sum(y^2), 4)`$ weeks$^2$, $\sum \log(y_j)^2=`r round(sum(log(y)^2), 4)`$ log(weeks)$^2$,  
$\sum x_iy_j=`r round(sum(x*y), 4)`$ years$\cdot$weeks, $\sum x_i\log(y_j)=`r round(sum(x*log(y)), 4)`$ years$\cdot$log(weeks), $\sum \log(x_i)y_j=`r round(sum(log(x)*y), 4)`$ log(years)$\cdot$weeks, $\sum \log(x_i)\log(y_j)=`r round(sum(log(x)*log(y)), 4)`$ log(years)$\cdot$log(weeks).

a. Which regression models, linear, exponential or logarithmic, explains better the relation between the age and the gestation time? 

a. Use the best model to predict the gestation time for a mother 45 years old. Is this prediction reliable?

a. According to the linear model, how much increases or decreases the gestation time for every year of the mother?

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Solution
a. Linear model: $\overline{x}=`r round(mx,4)`$ years, $s_x^2=`r round(s2x,4)`$ years$^2$.  
$\bar y=`r round(my,4)`$ weeks, $s_y^2=`r round(s2y,4)`$ weeks$^2$.  
$s_{xy}=`r round(sxy,4)`$ years$\cdot$weeks.  
$r^2 = `r round(r2xy, 4)`$. 

    Exponential model: $\overline{\ln(y)} = `r round(mlogy, 4)`$ ln(weeks), $s_{\ln(y)}^2 = `r round(s2logy, 4)`$ ln(weeks)$^2$  
    $s_{x\ln(y)} = `r round(sxlogy, 4)`$ years$\cdot\ln$(weeks).  
    $r^2 = `r round(r2xlogy, 4)`$.  

    Logarithmic model: $\overline{\ln(x)} = `r round(mlogx, 4)`$ ln(years), $s_{\ln(x)}^2 = `r round(s2logx, 4)`$  ln(years)$^2$  
    $s_{\ln(x)y} = `r round(slogxy, 4)`$ ln(years)weeks.  
    $r^2 = `r round(r2logxy, 4)`$.

    As the linear coefficient of determination is greater, the linear model explains better the relation between de gestation time and the age of the mother. 

a. 
Linear regression model of $Y$ on $X$: $y = `r round(reglin$coefficients[1], 4)` + `r round(reglin$coefficients[2], 4)` x$.  
Predictions: $y(45) = `r round(reglin$coefficients[1] + reglin$coefficients[2] * 45, 4)`$ weeks.  
The predictions are not reliable because the coefficient of determination is pretty low.

a. Regression coefficient of $Y$ on $X$: $b_{yx} = `r round(reglin$coefficients[2], 4)`$ weeks/year. The gestation time increases $`r round(reglin$coefficients[2], 4)`$ weeks per year.
