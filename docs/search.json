A sample of 40 mothers was taken and the sums below summarize the results (\\(X\\)=Age and \\(Y\\)=Gestation time):\n\\(\\sum x_i=1262\\) years, \\(\\sum \\log(x_i)=137.0078\\) log(years), \\(\\sum y_j=1583.6\\) weeks, \\(\\sum \\log(y_j)=147.1305\\) log(weeks),\n\\(\\sum x_i^2=41862\\) years\\(^2\\), \\(\\sum \\log(x_i)^2=471.4222\\) log(years)\\(^2\\), \\(\\sum y_j^2=62734.685\\) weeks\\(^2\\), \\(\\sum \\log(y_j)^2=541.2096\\) log(weeks)\\(^2\\),\n\\(\\sum x_iy_j=50116.7\\) years\\(\\cdot\\)weeks, \\(\\sum x_i\\log(y_j)=4645.8\\) years\\(\\cdot\\)log(weeks), \\(\\sum \\log(x_i)y_j=5428.9192\\) log(years)\\(\\cdot\\)weeks, \\(\\sum \\log(x_i)\\log(y_j)=504.0696\\) log(years)\\(\\cdot\\)log(weeks).\n\nWhich regression models, linear, exponential or logarithmic, explains better the relation between the age and the gestation time?\nUse the best model to predict the gestation time for a mother 45 years old. Is this prediction reliable?\nAccording to the linear model, how much increases or decreases the gestation time for every year of the mother?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinear model: \\(\\overline{x}=31.55\\) years, \\(s_x^2=51.1475\\) years\\(^2\\).\n\\(\\bar y=39.59\\) weeks, \\(s_y^2=0.999\\) weeks\\(^2\\).\n\\(s_{xy}=3.853\\) years\\(\\cdot\\)weeks.\n\\(r^2 = 0.2905\\).\nExponential model: \\(\\overline{\\ln(y)} = 3.6783\\) ln(weeks), \\(s_{\\ln(y)}^2 = 0.0006\\) ln(weeks)\\(^2\\)\n\\(s_{x\\ln(y)} = 0.0958\\) years\\(\\cdot\\ln\\)(weeks).\n\\(r^2 = 0.2882\\).\nLogarithmic model: \\(\\overline{\\ln(x)} = 3.4252\\) ln(years), \\(s_{\\ln(x)}^2 = 0.0536\\) ln(years)\\(^2\\)\n\\(s_{\\ln(x)y} = 0.1195\\) ln(years)weeks.\n\\(r^2 = 0.2668\\).\nAs the linear coefficient of determination is greater, the linear model explains better the relation between de gestation time and the age of the mother.\nLinear regression model of \\(Y\\) on \\(X\\): \\(y = 37.2133 + 0.0753 x\\).\nPredictions: \\(y(45) = 40.6032\\) weeks.\nThe predictions are not reliable because the coefficient of determination is pretty low.\nRegression coefficient of \\(Y\\) on \\(X\\): \\(b_{yx} = 0.0753\\) weeks/year. The gestation time increases \\(0.0753\\) weeks per year."

Then \\(X\\sim P(0.2)\\) and \\(P(X&gt;1)=0.0175\\).\nThe probability that a person who drank 2 litres of contaminated water is infected is \\(P(X\\geq 1) = 0.1813\\).

Does the outcome of the test depend on whether a man has prostate cancer?\nIs this a good test to diagnose the disease?\nWhat should be the minimum specificity of the test to diagnose the disease with a positive outcome?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSensitivity = \\(P(+|D) = 0.2\\). The outcome of the test does not depend on the prostate cancer.\nPositive predictive value = \\(P(D|+) = 0.02 &lt; 0.5\\), so we can not confirm the prostate cancer with a positive outcome.\nMinimum specificity \\(0.9959\\)."
