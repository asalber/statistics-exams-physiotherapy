In which group is the mean more representative. Justify the answer.\nWhich distribution is less symmetric, the one of patients younger than 65 or the one of patients older?\nWhich age is relatively smaller with respect to its group, 50 years in the group of patients younger than 65 or 72 years in the group of patients older than 65?\n\nUse the following sums for the computations.\nYounger than 65: \\(\\sum x_i=953\\) years, \\(\\sum x_i^2=52475\\) years\\(^2\\), \\(\\sum (x_i-\\bar x)^3=-30846.51\\) years\\(^3\\) and \\(\\sum (x_i-\\bar x)^4=939658.83\\) years\\(^4\\).\nOlder than 65: \\(\\sum x_i=588\\) years, \\(\\sum x_i^2=43530\\) years\\(^2\\), \\(\\sum (x_i-\\bar x)^3=1485\\) years\\(^3\\) and \\(\\sum (x_i-\\bar x)^4=26983.5\\) years\\(^4\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(Q_1=53\\) years, \\(Q_2=59\\) years and \\(Q_3=68\\) years.\nThere are 2 outliers: 25, 30.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet \\(x\\) be the age in patients younger than 65 and \\(y\\) the age in patients older than 65.\n\\(\\bar x=52.9444\\) years, \\(s_x^2=112.1636\\) years\\(^2\\), \\(s_x=10.5907\\) years and \\(cv_x=0.2\\).\n\\(\\bar y=73.5\\) years, \\(s_y^2=39\\) years\\(^2\\), \\(s_y=6.245\\) years and \\(cv_y=0.085\\).\nThe mean is more representative in patients older than 65 since the coefficient of variation is smaller.\n\\(g_{1x}=-1.4426\\) and \\(g_{1y}=0.7621\\), thus the distribution of ages of people younger than 65 is less symmetric.\nThe standard scores are \\(z_x(50)=-0.278\\) and \\(z_y(72)=-0.2402\\), thus 50 years is relative smaller in the group of people younger than 65.\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1.2  \n\n\n\nThe table below shows the number of injuries of several teams during a league and the average warm-up time of its players.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    Warm-up time \n    15 \n    35 \n    22 \n    28 \n    21 \n    18 \n    25 \n    30 \n    23 \n    20 \n  \n  \n    Injuries \n    42 \n    2 \n    16 \n    6 \n    17 \n    29 \n    10 \n    3 \n    12 \n    20 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDraw the scatter plot.\nWhich regression model is more suitable to predict the number of injuries as a function of the warm-up time, the logarithmic or the exponential? Use that regression model to predict the expected number of injuries for a team whose players warm-up 20 minutes a day.\nWhich regression model is more suitable to predict the warm-up time as a function of the number of injuries, the logarithmic or the exponential? Use that regression model to predict the warm-up time required to have no more than 10 injuries in a league.\nAre these predictions reliable? Which one is more reliable?\n\nUse the following sums for the computations (\\(X\\) warm-up time and \\(Y\\) number of injuries):\n\\(\\sum x_i=237\\), \\(\\sum \\log(x_i)=31.3728\\), \\(\\sum y_j=157\\), \\(\\sum \\log(y_j)=24.0775\\),\n\\(\\sum x_i^2=5937\\), \\(\\sum \\log(x_i)^2=98.9906\\), \\(\\sum y_j^2=3843\\), \\(\\sum \\log(y_j)^2=66.3721\\),\n\\(\\sum x_iy_j=3115\\), \\(\\sum x_i\\log(y_j)=519.1907\\), \\(\\sum \\log(x_i)y_j=465.8093\\), \\(\\sum \\log(x_i)\\log(y_j)=73.3995\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\bar x=23.7\\) min, \\(s_x^2=32.01\\) min\\(^2\\).\n\\(\\overline{\\log(x)}=3.1373\\) log(min), \\(s_{\\log(x)}^2=0.0565\\) log(min)\\(^2\\).\n\\(\\bar y=15.7\\) injuries, \\(s_y^2=137.81\\) injuries\\(^2\\).\n\\(\\overline{\\log(y)}=2.4078\\) log(injuries), \\(s_{\\log(y)}^2=0.8399\\) log(injuries)\\(^2\\).\n\\(s_{x\\log(y)}=-5.1446\\), \\(s_{\\log(x)y}=-2.6744\\)\nExponential determination coefficient: \\(r^2=0.9844\\)\nLogarithmic determination coefficient: \\(r^2=0.9185\\)\nSo the exponential regression model es better to predict the number of injuries as a function of the warm-up time.\nExponential regression model: \\(y=e^{6.2168+-0.1607x}\\).\nPrediction: \\(y(20)=20.1341\\) injuries.\nThe logarithmic model is better to predict the warm-up time as a function of the number or injuries.\nLogarithmic regression model: \\(x=164.1851+-47.3292\\log(y)\\).\nPrediction: \\(x(10)=55.2056112\\) min.\nBoth predictions are very reliable since de deternation coefficient is very high but the last one is a little less reliable as it is for a value further from the data range."
