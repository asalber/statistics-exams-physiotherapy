The ages of a sample of patients of a physical therapy clinic are:

\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{r|r|r|r|r|r|r|r|r|r|r|r|r}
\hline
25 & 30 & 44 & 44 & 51 & 51 & 53 & 56 & 57 & 58 & 58 & 58 & 59\\
\hline
59 & 61 & 63 & 63 & 63 & 66 & 68 & 70 & 71 & 72 & 74 & 82 & 85\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\item
  Compute the quartiles.
\item
  Draw the box plot and identify outliers (do not group data into
  intervals).
\item
  Split the sample into two groups, patients younger and older than 65.
  In which group is the mean more representative. Justify the answer.
\item
  Which distribution is less symmetric, the one of patients younger than
  65 or the one of patients older?
\item
  Which age is relatively smaller with respect to its group, 50 years in
  the group of patients younger than 65 or 72 years in the group of
  patients older than 65?
\end{enumerate}

Use the following sums for the computations.\\
Younger than 65: \(\sum x_i=953\) years, \(\sum x_i^2=52475\)
years\(^2\), \(\sum (x_i-\bar x)^3=-30846.51\) years\(^3\) and
\(\sum (x_i-\bar x)^4=939658.83\) years\(^4\).\\
Older than 65: \(\sum x_i=588\) years, \(\sum x_i^2=43530\) years\(^2\),
\(\sum (x_i-\bar x)^3=1485\) years\(^3\) and
\(\sum (x_i-\bar x)^4=26983.5\) years\(^4\).

  \(s_x=10.5907\) years and \(cv_x=0.2\).\\
  \(\bar y=73.5\) years, \(s_y^2=39\) years\(^2\), \(s_y=6.245\) years
  and \(cv_y=0.085\).\\
  The mean is more representative in patients older than 65 since the
  coefficient of variation is smaller.
\item
  \(g_{1x}=-1.4426\) and \(g_{1y}=0.7621\), thus the distribution of
  ages of people younger than 65 is less symmetric.
\item
  The standard scores are \(z_x(50)=-0.278\) and \(z_y(72)=-0.2402\),
  thus 50 years is relative smaller in the group of people younger than
  65.

The table below shows the number of injuries of several teams during a
league and the average warm-up time of its players.

\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l|r|r|r|r|r|r|r|r|r|r}

\hline
Injuries & 42 & 2 & 16 & 6 & 17 & 29 & 10 & 3 & 12 & 20\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\item
  Draw the scatter plot.
\item
  Which regression model is more suitable to predict the number of
  injuries as a function of the warm-up time, the logarithmic or the
  exponential? Use that regression model to predict the expected number
  of injuries for a team whose players warm-up 20 minutes a day.
\item
  Which regression model is more suitable to predict the warm-up time as
  a function of the number of injuries, the logarithmic or the
  exponential? Use that regression model to predict the warm-up time
  required to have no more than 10 injuries in a league.
\item
  Are these predictions reliable? Which one is more reliable?
\end{enumerate}

Use the following sums for the computations (\(X\) warm-up time and
\(Y\) number of injuries):\\
\(\sum x_i=237\), \(\sum \log(x_i)=31.3728\), \(\sum y_j=157\),
\(\sum \log(y_j)=24.0775\),\\
\(\sum x_i^2=5937\), \(\sum \log(x_i)^2=98.9906\), \(\sum y_j^2=3843\),
\(\sum \log(y_j)^2=66.3721\),\\
\(\sum x_iy_j=3115\), \(\sum x_i\log(y_j)=519.1907\),
\(\sum \log(x_i)y_j=465.8093\), \(\sum \log(x_i)\log(y_j)=73.3995\).

\end{enumerate}

\includegraphics{img/exam2018-05-31/scatterplot-injuries-warm-up-1.pdf}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\item
  \(\bar x=23.7\) min, \(s_x^2=32.01\) min\(^2\).\\
  \(\overline{\log(x)}=3.1373\) log(min), \(s_{\log(x)}^2=0.0565\)
  log(min)\(^2\).\\
  \(\bar y=15.7\) injuries, \(s_y^2=137.81\) injuries\(^2\).\\
  \(\overline{\log(y)}=2.4078\) log(injuries), \(s_{\log(y)}^2=0.8399\)
  log(injuries)\(^2\).\\
  \(s_{x\log(y)}=-5.1446\), \(s_{\log(x)y}=-2.6744\)\\
  Exponential determination coefficient: \(r^2=0.9844\)\\
  Logarithmic determination coefficient: \(r^2=0.9185\)\\
  So the exponential regression model es better to predict the number of
  injuries as a function of the warm-up time.\\
  Exponential regression model: \(y=e^{6.2168+-0.1607x}\).\\
  Prediction: \(y(20)=20.1341\) injuries.
\item
  The logarithmic model is better to predict the warm-up time as a
  function of the number or injuries.\\
  Logarithmic regression model: \(x=164.1851+-47.3292\log(y)\).\\
  Prediction: \(x(10)=55.2056112\) min.
\item
  Both predictions are very reliable since de deternation coefficient is
  very high but the last one is a little less reliable as it is for a
  value further from the data range.

  random person from the population and measuring if he or she consumes
  cocaine and if he or she has a heart attack.

  not consume cocaine and does not have a heart attack.
\item
  Are the events of consuming cocaine and having a heart attack

The creatine phosphokinase (CPK3) is an enzyme in the body that causes
the phosphorylation of creatine. This enzyme is found in the skeletal
muscle and can be measured in a blood analysis. The concentration of
CPK3 in blood is normally distributed, and the interval centered at the
mean with the reference values, that accumulates 99\%: of the
population, ranges from 40 to 308 IU/L in healthy adult males.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\item
  Compute the mean and the standard deviation of the concentration of
  CPK3 in healthy males.\\
  Note: If you are not able to compute the standard deviation, use
  \(\sigma = 50\) UI/L for the next parts.
\item
  A diagnostic test to detect muscular dystrophy gives a negative
  outcome when the concentration of CPK3 is below 300 UI/L. Compute the
  specificity of the test.
\item
  If the concentration of CPK3 in people with muscular dystrophy also
  follows a normal distribution with mean 350 IU/L and the same standard
  deviation, what is the sensitivity of the test?
\item
  Compute the predictive values of the test and interpret them assuming
  that the muscular dystrophy prevalence is 8\%.

\item
  Sensitivity = \(0.8321\).\\
  The test is better to confirm the disease as the specificity is
  greater than the sensitivity.
\item
  PPV = \(0.9046\). Thus, we can diagnose the disease with a positive
  outcome.\\

\item
  If it is required an assessment greater than 5 in more than 50\%: of
  patients for the clinic to remain open, will the clinic remain open?
\item
  Is the assessment mean representative?
\item
  Compute the coefficient of kurtosis of the assessment and interpret

Let \(X\) be the patient assessment. a. \(Q_1= 4.4444\), \(Q_3=9.0907\)
and \(IQR = 4.6463\), so the central dispersion is moderate.

\begin{enumerate}

\item
  \(\bar x = 6.375\), \(s_x^2 = 6.2344\), \(s_x=2.4969\) and

\item
  \(g_2 = -0.9335\) and the distribution is flatter than a Gauss bell,

\item
  First clinic: \(z(6)=-0.1502\)\\

  Sensitivity = \(P(+|D) = 0.2\). The outcome of the test does not
  depend on the prostate cancer.
\item
  Positive predictive value = \(P(D|+) = 0.02 < 0.5\), so we can not

To see if the confinement due to COVID-19 influenced the performance of
a course, the number of failed subjects of each student in the current
course and in the previous year course has been counted, obtaining the
table below.

\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{r|r|r}
\hline
Failed subjects & Previous year course & Current course\\
\hline
0 & 7 & 8\\
\hline

5 & 2 & 2\\

\end{tabular}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\item
  Draw the box plots of the failed subjects in the current and the
  previous year courses and compare them.
\item
  Can we assume that both samples come from a normal population?
\item
  In which sample is the mean more representative?
\item
  Which number of failed subjects is relatively greater, 7 in the
  current course or 6 in the previous year course?
\end{enumerate}

Use the following sums for the computations:\\
Previous year course: \(\sum x_i=84\) subjects, \(\sum x_i^2=254\)
subjects\(^2\), \(\sum (x_i-\bar x)^3=122.99\) subjects\(^3\) y
\(\sum (x_i-\bar x)^4=669.21\) subjects\(^4\).\\
Current course: \(\sum x_i=91\) subjects, \(\sum x_i^2=341\)
subjects\(^2\), \(\sum (x_i-\bar x)^3=301.16\) subjects\(^3\) y
\(\sum (x_i-\bar x)^4=2012.88\) subjects\(^4\).

  \(g_2 = 0.1874\).\\
  Current course: \(\bar x = 2.1163\) subjects, \(s_x^2=3.4516\)
  subjects\(^2\), \(s_x=1.8578\) subjects, \(g_1 = 1.0922\) and
  \(g_2 = 0.9292\).\\
  In both courses the coefficients of skewness and kurtosis are between
  -2 and 2, so we can assume that both samples come from a normal
  population.
\item
  Previous year course: \(cv = 0.7873\).\\
  Current year course: \(cv = 0.8779\).\\
  As the coefficient of variation of the previous year course is
  smaller, its mean is a little bit more representative.
\item
  Previous year course: \(z(6) = 2.8124\).\\
  Current course: \(z(7) = 2.6287\).\\
  Thus, 6 failed subjects is relative greater in the previous year
  course than 7 failed subjects in the current course.

In a city of 3.5 million inhabitants there are three urban transport
systems: metro, bus and tram. In general, on a working day, the number
of travelers is 1.500.000 for the metro, 750.000 for the bus and 450.000
for the tram. Moreover, it is known that 30\% of metro travelers also
use the bus, 10\% of metro travelers also use the tram and 5\% of metro
travelers also use both bus and tram. Finally, 15\% of bus travelers
also use the tram. (Hint: An inhabitant can take or not the urban
transport).

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\item
  Calculate the probability that, on a working day, an inhabitant uses
  only one of three transport systems.
\item
  Calculate the probability that, in a working day, an inhabitant uses
  at least one transport system.
\item
  When only a transport system is used, there is a 2\% probability of
  having a delay of more than 5 minutes on a working day. However, the
  probability of having such a delay rises to 7\% when combining more
  than one transport system in a working day. Calculate the probability
  that an inhabitant suffers a delay of more than 5 minutes on a working
  day.
\item
  With the same information as in part (c) and knowing that a traveler
  suffered a delay of more than 5 minutes, calculate the probability
  that this traveler took more than one transport system.

To study the effectiveness of an exercise program in front of the
computer to delay the onset of presbyopia, a sample of 1000 40-year-old
people without presbyopia was taken and divided into two groups of equal
size. One group followed the exercise program and the other did not.
After 10 years there were 45 people who developed presbyopia in the
group that followed the exercise program and 125 in the group that did
not follow the program.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\item
  Calculate the risk of developing presbyopia without following the
  exercise program.
\item
  Calculate the relative risk of developing presbyopia if the exercise
  program is followed and interpret it.
\item
  Calculate the odds ratio of developing presbyopia if the exercise
  program is followed and interpret it.
\item
  What type of association measure is most appropriate in this study?
\item
  If a sample of 20 40-year-old people without presbyopia is taken, what
  is the probability that at least 2 will develop presbyopia if they do
  not follow the exercise program?
\item
  If a sample of 100 40-year-old people without presbyopia is taken,
  what is the probability that fewer than 2 will develop presbyopia if
  they follow the exercise program?
