The assessments are summarized in the table below.\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{lr} \n\\hline\n\\mbox{Assessment} & \\mbox{Patients}\\\\  \n0 - 2 & 3\\\\\n2 - 4 & 12\\\\  \n4 - 6 & 9\\\\ \n6 - 8 & 18\\\\ \n8 - 10 & 22\\\\ \n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\na. Compute the interquartile range of the assessment and interpret it.\n\na. If it is required an assessment greater than 5 in more than 50%: of patients for the clinic to remain open, will the clinic remain open?\n\na. Is the assessment mean representative?\n\na. Compute the coefficient of kurtosis of the assessment and interpret it. Is the kurtosis normal?\n\na. If the assessment mean of another clinic is 6.8 and the standard deviation is 2.6,  which assessment is relatively higher 6 in the first clinic or 6.2 in the second?\n\n\nUse the following sums for the computations:  \n$\\sum x_in_i=408$, $\\sum x_i^2n_i=3000$, $\\sum (x_i-\\bar x)^3n_i=-548.25$ and $\\sum (x_i-\\bar x)^4n_i=5140.45$.\n\n:::{.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n## Solution\nLet $X$ be the patient assessment.\na. $Q_1= 4.4444$, $Q_3=9.0907$ and $IQR = 4.6463$, so the central dispersion is moderate.\n\na. $F(5)=0.2695$, and the percentage of patients with an assessment greater than 5 is $73.05%:$.\n\na. $\\bar x = 6.375$, $s_x^2 = 6.2344$, $s_x=2.4969$ and $cv=0.3917$, thus the representativity of the mean is moderate.\n\na. $g_2 = -0.9335$ and the distribution is flatter than a Gauss bell, but normal, as $g_2$ is between -2 and 2.\n\na. First clinic: $z(6)=-0.1502$   \nSecond clinic: $z(6.2)=-0.3077$.  \nThus, an assessment of 6 in the first clinic is relatively higher as its standard score is greater. \n:::\n:::\n\n:::{#exr-2}\n\n::: {.cell hash='exam-2022-06-06-des_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-2_da663bac73481efdbdbfa91e1a67a78b'}\n\n:::\n\n\nA study tries to determine the effectiveness a training program to increase the grip strength.

Compute the regression coefficient of the grip strength on the weeks and interpret it.\n\na. According to the logarithmic regression model, what is the expected grip strength after 5 and 25 weeks. Are these predictions reliable? Would these predictions be more reliable with the linear regression model?\n\na. According to the exponential regression model, how many weeks are required to have a grip strength of 25 Kg?\n\na. What percentage of the total variability of the weeks is explained by the exponential model?\n\nUse the following sums ($X$=Weeks and $Y$=Grip strength):  \n$\\sum x_i=95$, $\\sum \\log(x_i)=16.7824$, $\\sum y_j=256$, $\\sum \\log(y_j)=27.3423$,  \n$\\sum x_i^2=1629$, $\\sum \\log(x_i)^2=43.606$, $\\sum y_j^2=8804$, $\\sum \\log(y_j)^2=94.3237$,  \n$\\sum x_iy_j=3552$, $\\sum x_i\\log(y_j)=342.9642$, $\\sum \\log(x_i)y_j=608.4186$, $\\sum \\log(x_i)\\log(y_j)=60.047$.\n\n:::{.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n## Solution\na. $\\overline{x}=11.875$ weeks, $s_x^2=62.6094$ weeks$^2$.  \n$\\bar y=32$ Kg, $s_y^2=76.5$ Kg$^2$.  \n$s_{xy}=64$ weeks$\\cdot$Kg.  \nRegression coefficient of $Y$ on $X$: $b_{yx} = 1.0222$ Kg/weeek. The grip strength increases $1.0222$ Kg per week.\n\na. $\\overline{\\ln(x)} = 2.0978$ ln(weeks), $s_{\\ln(x)}^2 = 1.05$  ln(weeks)$^2$ and $s_{\\ln(x)y} = 8.9226$ ln(weeks)Kg.  \nLogarithmic regression model of $Y$ on $X$: $y = 14.1729 + 8.498 \\ln(x)$.  \nPredictions: $y(5) = 27.8499$ Kg and $y(25) = 41.5268$ Kg.  \nLogarithmic coefficient of determination: $r^2 = 0.9912$.\nThe predictions are not reliable because the sample size is small.  \nLinear coefficient of determination: $r^2 = 0.8552$.  \nAs the linear coefficient of determination is less than the logarithmic one, the predictions with the logarithmic model are more reliable.\n\na. Exponential regression model of $X$ on $Y$: $x = e^{-1.6345 + 0.1166y}$.  \nPrediction: $x(25)=3.6015$ Weeks.  \n\na. As $r^2 = 0.9912$, the exponential models explains $99.12$%: of the variability of the weeks.  \n:::\n:::\n",
