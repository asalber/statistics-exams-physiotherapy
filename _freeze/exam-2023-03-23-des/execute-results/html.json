A sample of 40 mothers was taken and the sums below summarize the results ($X$=Age and $Y$=Gestation time):\n\n$\\sum x_i=1262$ years, $\\sum \\log(x_i)=137.0078$ log(years), $\\sum y_j=1583.6$ weeks, $\\sum \\log(y_j)=147.1305$ log(weeks),  \n$\\sum x_i^2=41862$ years$^2$, $\\sum \\log(x_i)^2=471.4222$ log(years)$^2$, $\\sum y_j^2=62734.685$ weeks$^2$, $\\sum \\log(y_j)^2=541.2096$ log(weeks)$^2$,  \n$\\sum x_iy_j=50116.7$ years$\\cdot$weeks, $\\sum x_i\\log(y_j)=4645.8$ years$\\cdot$log(weeks), $\\sum \\log(x_i)y_j=5428.9192$ log(years)$\\cdot$weeks, $\\sum \\log(x_i)\\log(y_j)=504.0696$ log(years)$\\cdot$log(weeks).\n\na. Which regression models, linear, exponential or logarithmic, explains better the relation between the age and the gestation time? \n\na. Use the best model to predict the gestation time for a mother 45 years old. Is this prediction reliable?\n\na. According to the linear model, how much increases or decreases the gestation time for every year of the mother?\n\n:::{.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n## Solution\na. Linear model: $\\overline{x}=31.55$ years, $s_x^2=51.1475$ years$^2$.  \n$\\bar y=39.59$ weeks, $s_y^2=0.999$ weeks$^2$.  \n$s_{xy}=3.853$ years$\\cdot$weeks.  \n$r^2 = 0.2905$. \n\n    Exponential model: $\\overline{\\ln(y)} = 3.6783$ ln(weeks), $s_{\\ln(y)}^2 = 0.0006$ ln(weeks)$^2$  \n    $s_{x\\ln(y)} = 0.0958$ years$\\cdot\\ln$(weeks).  \n    $r^2 = 0.2882$.  \n\n    Logarithmic model: $\\overline{\\ln(x)} = 3.4252$ ln(years), $s_{\\ln(x)}^2 = 0.0536$  ln(years)$^2$  \n    $s_{\\ln(x)y} = 0.1195$ ln(years)weeks.  \n    $r^2 = 0.2668$.\n\n    As the linear coefficient of determination is greater, the linear model explains better the relation between de gestation time and the age of the mother. \n\na. \nLinear regression model of $Y$ on $X$: $y = 37.2133 + 0.0753 x$.  \nPredictions: $y(45) = 40.6032$ weeks.  \nThe predictions are not reliable because the coefficient of determination is pretty low.\n\na. Regression coefficient of $Y$ on $X$: $b_{yx} = 0.0753$ weeks/year. The gestation time increases $0.0753$ weeks per year.\n:::\n:::",
