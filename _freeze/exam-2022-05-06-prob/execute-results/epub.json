It is also known that 4%: of people who consume cocaine have a heart attack and 10%: of people who have a heart attack consume cocaine.\n\n\na. Construct the probability tree for the random experiment of drawing a random person from the population and measuring if he or she consumes cocaine and if he or she has a heart attack.\n\na. Compute the probability that a random person of the population does not consume cocaine and does not have a heart attack.\n\na. Are the events of consuming cocaine and having a heart attack dependent?\n\na. Compute the relative risk and the odds ratio of suffering a heart attack consuming cocaine. Which association measure is more suitable for this study? Interpret it.\n\n:::{.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n## Solution\nLet $C$ the event of consuming cocaine and $H$ the event of having a heart attack.\n\na.\n\n:::{.content-visible when-format=\"html\"}\n![Probability tree](img/exam-2022-05-06/probability-tree-cocaine.svg)\n:::\n\n:::{.content-visible unless-format=\"html\"}\n![Probability tree](img/exam-2022-05-06/probability-tree-cocaine.pdf)\n:::\n\na. $P(\\overline C\\cap \\overline H)=0.8912$.\n\na. The events are dependent as $P(C)=0.08\\neq P(C|H)=0.1$.\n\na. $RR(H)=1.2778$ and $OR(H)=1.2894$. The odds ratio is more suitable as the study is retrospective. That means that the odds of having a heart attack is $1.2894$ times greater if a person consumes cocaine.\n:::\n:::\n\n:::{#exr-2}\n\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='exam-2022-05-06-prob_cache/epub/unnamed-chunk-2_e48b85406c896f2dc77c5725fdff0ecc'}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\nA basketball player scores 12 points per game on average.\n\n\na. What is the probability that the player scores more than 4 points in a quarter?\n\na. If the player plays 10 games in a league, what is the probability of scoring less than 6 points in some game?\n\n:::{.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n## Solution\n\na. Let $X$ be the points scored in a quarter by the player. Then $X\\sim P(3)$, and $P(X>4)=0.1847$.\n\na. Let $Y$ be the number of points scored in a game by the player. Then $Y\\sim P(12)$ and $P(Y<6)=0.0203$.  \nLet $Z$ be the number of games with less than 6 points scored by the player. Then $Z\\sim B(10, 0.0203)$, and $P(Z>0)=0.1858$.\n:::\n:::\n\n:::{#exr-3}\n\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='exam-2022-05-06-prob_cache/epub/unnamed-chunk-3_a22a92d61f9dd1c90cff0730218796f6'}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThe creatine phosphokinase (CPK3) is an enzyme in the body that causes the phosphorylation of creatine. This enzyme is found in the skeletal muscle and can be measured in a blood analysis. The concentration of CPK3 in blood is normally distributed, and the interval centered at the mean with the reference values, that accumulates 99%: of the population, ranges from 40 to 308 IU/L in healthy adult males.\n \na. Compute the mean and the standard deviation of the concentration of CPK3 in healthy males.  \nNote: If you are not able to compute the standard deviation, use $\\sigma = 50$ UI/L for the next parts.\n\na. A diagnostic test to detect muscular dystrophy gives a negative outcome when the concentration of CPK3 is below 300 UI/L. Compute the specificity of the test.\n\na. If the concentration of CPK3 in people with muscular dystrophy also follows a normal distribution with mean 350 IU/L and the same standard deviation, what is the sensitivity of the test?\n\na. Compute the predictive values of the test and interpret them assuming that the muscular dystrophy prevalence is 8%.\n\n:::{.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n## Solution\n\na. $\\mu = 174$ IU/L and $\\sigma = 51.938$ IU/L.\n\na. Specificity = $0.9924$.\n\na. Sensitivity = $0.8321$.  \nThe test is better to confirm the disease as the specificity is greater than the sensitivity.\n\na. PPV = $0.9046$. Thus, we can diagnose the disease with a positive outcome.  \nNPV = $0.9855$. Thus, we can rule out the disease with a negative outcome.\n:::\n:::",
